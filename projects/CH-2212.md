Originally a 1920â€™s Model-T ford showroom and workshop with an apartment on the upper floor. This long abandoned and neglected gem required seismically strengthening, fire engineering upgrades, new cladding and restoration throughout to provide great value to its future occupant. 
Another building back online and adding value to the town of Opotiki
