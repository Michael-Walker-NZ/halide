title: CRESTOP HOUSE - OPOTIKI
description: >
  Top of crest amongst rolling green fields and native trees overlooking the Bay of Plenty with White & Whale Island in the distance. The brief for this design was to provide the ultimate palatial dream home for its 5x person family to replace the current dilapidated 90â€™s house not deserved of its site. This client is currently lining up their ducks so this dream can be achieved.
