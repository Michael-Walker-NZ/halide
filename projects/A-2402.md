title: HILLS HOUSE ALTERATION - CHRISTCHURCH
description: >
  A large 1930â€™s NZ classic home in original condition on a large steep site down a prestigious Christchurch hillside avenue. The brief consisted of more open plan living, more expansive glazing, a large wrap around deck with views over the city and a new Bedroom with deck providing a new link to the rear of the site. A new detached, self-contained studio nestled amongst the trees with its own character is also provided. All totalling a design which maximises the site and pays respect to the design heritage of the existing house
