title: SHIRLEY HOUSE - CHRISTCHURCH
description: >
  Clients who were not looking for a ‘showy’ design. Rather a solid traditional, efficiently designed house which maximises the size of the site. A result which did not come easily. A large amount of design revisions and rounds of problem solving resulted in a very well planned forever home the clients do not intend to leave.
