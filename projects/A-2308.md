title: FERN HOUSE ALTERATION - CHRISTCHURCH
description: >
  A small original 1930’s bungalow on a heavily planted 1650 square meter Cashmere Christchurch site. This green fingered client spied an opportunity. An expansion was required to cater for a 5x person family. While happy with the first weatherboard gable formed concept to complement the existing house. The design pivoted to contemporary brick form inspired by the client’s fondness of the Woolston brick tannery. A fantastic place for their 3x children to grow up. A home which maximises its woodland setting nestled amongst the city
