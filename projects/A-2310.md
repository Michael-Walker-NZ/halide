A 1930â€™s Queenstown classic Bach overlooking Lake Wakatipu. This expertly crafted concept by Roy Tebbutt of SGA Architects retains and compliments the existing character while providing new indoor and outdoor living spaces which open to the lakefront views and draw in sunlight from the rear. The detailed design required a large amount of well crafted, complex detailing on an express programme. A design which will continue to be a Queenstown classic.
