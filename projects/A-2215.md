title: WAINUI BACH ALTERATION - BANKS PENINSULA
description: >
  A tired but classic 1950’s concrete block Bach with good bones in a beautiful, secluded Banks Peninsula setting. The overhaul included a new contrasting modern ‘black box’ living space connecting with the outdoors. While the existing Bach received new insulated cladding, a new warm roof and interior refresh. A fantastic getaway retreat.
