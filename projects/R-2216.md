title: TUATAPERE HOUSE
description: >
  After the government enforced COVID vaccinations these clients did not approve of, they decided they would sell up in Dunedin and buy land bordering Fiordland, Southland. Using their ideas, a highly efficiently floor plan was developed where living spaces and bedrooms get maximum views with covered outdoors spaces to the East and West to cater for differing weather and sunlight throughout the day. Designed without a structural engineer and no structural steel. Wrapped in durable coloursteel cladding to reference rural buildings of present and past. A self-built house which provides maximum value for money.
