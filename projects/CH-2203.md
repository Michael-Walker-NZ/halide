title: FRASER CAMERON BUILDING - OPOTIKI
description: >
  A category 02 listed Heritage building, built in 1935 in art deco style. After an initial short-term occupant, Bob Black's cycle shop, the shop has been occupied by two long-term businesses, D. and A. Croll milk bar and hardware business (c.1941-1964), and Fraser Cameron Limited's electrical and refrigeration goods and repairs service (1964- late 2000â€™s). 
  Recent government requirements deemed the building as an un-inhabitable Earthquake risk. After the client purchased the building a process was navigated to integrate seismic strengthening, fire engineering upgrades, Heritage NZ & Council Resource consent approval and incorporation of a tenants requirements for a Pizzeria eatery.
