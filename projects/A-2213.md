title: DELORAINE ST TOWNHOUSES - CHRISTCHURCH
description: >
  This 1970 Peter Beaven townhouse no longer catered for the size requirements of its owner and . On a small site there was no choice but to go up. A complex challenge of paying respect to its neighbouring unit and well-crafted proportions while incorporating a large amount of glazing for maximum views and sunlight. (Design done in conjunction with Tim Holmes Architect)
