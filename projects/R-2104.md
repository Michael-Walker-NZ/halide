title: LOWE HOUSE - MATAKANA
description: >
  An expertly crafted design by SGA Architects required an equally expertly crafted set of detailed design drawings. The house wraps around a central courtyard finishing with a covered snug outdoor fire place. Canterbury clay bricks and a top band of vertical abodo cladding provide a reference to European inspired houses provided by the client. Constructed in an efficient way with traditional materials and no structural steel. A unique favourite of many
